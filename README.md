## 3. TRANSFORMATION OF DATASETS

Excel was used to do some basic cleaning of the datasets. This was to remove any columns that were irrelevent to the question that was being investigated.

The image below is the raw `country_profiles_variables.csv` dataset from the source. The columns in blue were removed to make the information contained within it relevant

Pandas was then used to transform the .csv files into dataframes that could be further manipulated and joined together. An `id` column was added to act as a primary key.
